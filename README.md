# DijkstraSequentialVParallel

<p>All input and solution files are generated by the awesome people at <a href="https://www.infoarena.ro/">Infoarena</a>, specifially from the <a href="https://www.infoarena.ro/problema/dijkstra"> Dijkstra Educational Problem</a>.</p>
<p>Each run is verified by comparing the method result with the solution file.</p>
<p>The sequential Kotlin solution is based on one of my <a href="https://www.infoarena.ro/job_detail/1519825?action=view-source">old implementations in C++</a> evaluated on Infoarena as well.<p>

<h3> Sequential solution complexity analysis </h3>

<p>Our queue is a <b>PriorityQueue</b> which is using a heap for storing the sorted nodes based<br>
on the edge weight.</p>
<p>Such, for queue.add(node) and queue.remove() (getting the first element in the queue)<br>
we have a time complexity of O(logN) where N is the number of elements currently in the queue.<br></p>
<p>To update the minimum distance for a single edge will be O(logN) (from queue.add) and we have<br>
a total of M edges -> O(MlogN) to update all edges.</p>
<p>Finally since at each step we retrieve a node (with queue.remove) we have O(logN) for that<br>
and there areN nodes -> O(NlogN).</p>

<p>Putting these operations together will result in a total complexity of O(NlogN + MlogN) = O((N+M)logN).</p>
<p>And since we do this for each node we get O(N*(N+M)logN)</p>

fun determineShortestPathsSequential(): List<Int> {
    val queue = initQueue()
    ...
    queue.add(Edge(STARTING_NODE, STARTING_NODE, 0))
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
            node = queue.remove().nodeB
            graph[node]?.let {
                (0 until it.size).forEach { position ->
                    ...
                    if (distances[currentVertexInPath] > distances[node] + edgeWeight) {
                        ...
                        queue.add(Edge(node, currentVertexInPath, distances[currentVertexInPath]))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
